# NLP - Food Inspection Pass/Fail using Text Classification

I have used text classification on the Violations text to classify them as Passed or Failed.

* Extracted comments from violations text
* Data Cleaning
  * Cleaning punctuations, numbers, single character tokens
  * Removing stopwords, custom stopwords
  * Lemmatization
* Ran 3 models
  * Naive Bayes Model
  * Logistic Regression Model
  * Support Vector Machine
* Compared the model evaluation metrics 
* Highlighted the most important features (tokens) that led to Pass/Fail violation
